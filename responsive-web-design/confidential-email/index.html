      <p>Dear <span class="blurred">Kevin</span>,</p>

      <p>
        I hope this email reaches you before the
        <span class="blurred">Shapeshifter Squad</span> intercepts it — again.
        (Remind me to have <span class="blurred">IT Ferret #4</span> review our
        encryption protocols. I don’t trust him anymore.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Your mission is simple: infiltrate the
        <span class="blurred">Llama Sanctuary</span>. Yes, *that* sanctuary. We
        have intel that Captain Chameleon is hiding there — probably disguised
        as a particularly fluffy alpaca. Do not be fooled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once inside, deploy the
        <span class="blurred">Glitter Bomb Prototype #3</span> (DO NOT shake it
        this time), and retrieve the USB drive labeled
        <span class="blurred">"NOT A TRAP"</span>. It *is* a trap, but we need
        what's inside anyway.
      </p>

      <p>Also, stop wearing your Villain ID badge outside your coat.</p>

      <p>
        Failure will result in a strongly worded performance review. And
        possibly <span class="blurred">sharks</span>. You know how it goes.
      </p>

      <p>Unpleasantly yours,</p>

      <p><span class="blurred">Dr. Malevolus</span></p>
