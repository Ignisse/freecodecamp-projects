# FreeCodeCamp Projects

This repository contains my solutions and personal versions of projects from the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Certified Full Stack Developer Curriculum. I'm using this space to practice, learn, and track my progress as I go through each course.

## Current Course Progress

- **HTML** â€“ âœ… Completed  
- **CSS** â€“ ðŸ”„ In Progress

 Learning HTML and CSS fundamentals, building small web projects with different layout and styling techniques.

## Notes

These projects are meant for learning and experimentation. Some may be incomplete or purely exploratory (like testing out colors or layouts).
